The new title is good, but removes the clarity of the length of the data set.  It might be comprehensive for the last 10 years, which is the opposite of what is really done. Perhaps something like one of these:

- A Comprehensive 118 year Dataset of Notifiable Disease Incidence in Canada
- A Comprehensive Dataset of Notifiable Disease Incidence in Canada since 1903
- A Comprehensive Dataset of Notifiable Disease Incidence in Canada covering more than a century
- A Comprehensive Dataset of Notifiable Disease Incidence in Canada since the early 20th century

> SW: I agree and like the first option best because it is shortest.

What does "3-quarterly" data mean?  At 9 month intervals?

> SW: Yes. We could remove them from the dataset, but there are only ~500 records so I don't feel that it matters either way.

## Intro

line 5.  Here we say at least back to 1903, but in the abstract we refer to the late 19th century.  Do we clarify what data exist before 1903?

## Results

"harmonized" is first used here but not defined.

Figure 2 caption needs slight revision in light of changes we agreed on in colours etc.

I gather they require the figures in separate files at this stage?  It makes it painful to navigate because the hyperlinks don't take you to the figures.

You had \aref{fig:polio-peak-month}, which I changed to \cref{fig:polio-peak-month}, but I wonder if you intended this to come out differently and say section something figure something.  Certainly the way it was was wrong (\S Fig S6).
