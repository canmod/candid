The new title is good, but removes the clarity of the length of the data set.  It might be comprehensive for the last 10 years, which is the opposite of what is really done. Perhaps something like one of these:

- A Comprehensive 118 year Dataset of Notifiable Disease Incidence in Canada
- A Comprehensive Dataset of Notifiable Disease Incidence in Canada since 1903
- A Comprehensive Dataset of Notifiable Disease Incidence in Canada covering more than a century
- A Comprehensive Dataset of Notifiable Disease Incidence in Canada since the early 20th century

What does "3-quarterly" data mean?  At 9 month intervals?
